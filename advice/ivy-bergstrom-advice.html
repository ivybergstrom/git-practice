                <h4>Know your resoures!</h4>
                <p>Luckily, you are not the first person to learn how to code. There are hundreds of thousands of people who have asked the same questions that you will come across.
                  Know where you can go online toget this questions answered. The resources are *endless*.</p>

                <p>If you are a fellow skillcrusher, take advantage of the skillcrush slack channel. If not, check out stack overflow, and just google blogs and tutorials from other coders.</p>

                <h4>Make note of weak areas and develop plans to improve them</h4>
                <p>For example, I really struggled with Github. To help improve, I made flashcards of differet commands, vocabulary, and everything I had a hard time retaining.
                </p>

                <p>Another way to help wrap your mind around something challening is to write a small quiz for yourself, consisting of questions you have, then reasearch the answers. </p>

                <p>I hope this helps! Don't be discouraged by the challenge, you're doing something new and amazing.</p>
                <h4>Take opportunities to challenge yourself</h4>
                <p> And oh my god, have fun with it! Don't settle on your websites, keep trying until you love the way it looks.
                </p>
                <h4> Troubleshoot troubleshoot troubleshoot.
                </h4>
                <p> Like, I really cannot stress that enough. Whenever you troubleshoot something, and you will, write down what was wrong and how you fixed it.
                </p>
                <p> It helps build your semantic knowledge, which helps you have a more complete image of what you're doing grand scheme, rather than just in the immediate project you
                  are currently working on. It is good for your brain.

            <h3>Also, oh my god, you can do this! </h3>
              <p> Like seriously, you are so wonderfully and profoundly you! No one ever has, or ever can be a better you.
            You are rocking that, and you can rock this. If you are reading this, you have already made it to the git hub class. You've already made websites.
            You have moved digital mountains (and maybe some pictures of some literal mountains on your websites, maybe not, there is an idea for your next website, boom).
            The point is, you already made it this far, and that is amazing. There are still many more challenges (or as I like to think of them, digital adventures) ahead,
            but for now, pat yourself on the back, treat yo'self to a milk shake (or substitute with your own treat of choice), and bless yourself for being the wonderful queen/king that you are.
              </p>
            </div>
          <p> Also, not to like entirely change tones, but you still have so much to learn! It is okay if it feels a little daunting, but in like, an exciting way,
            like at the beginning of a new semester.
          </p>
          <p> But also, oh my god, you can do this. You can do hard things. Say it with me: you can do hard things. Why wouldn't you be able to? You have totally done ard things before.
            And guess what? You were fine. Maybe a little stressed (and a lot o'blessed), but you made it. The imposter syndrome is temporary.
            The fears you're feeling is temporary. You can do hard things.
          </p>
          <p> It is okay if it takes you a little longer to complete projects on some days, you will still have some quick days.
            It is okay if some things take a little extra reading and research. It is all part of the process. When taking notes, try to rewrite everything in your own words.
            It is strange but it helps. It is okay if you need extra practice or time. When you get burnt out, learn to rest, not to quit.
          </p>
          <p> But for real. You are amazing, you've done hard things and they have made you stronger, you've got this. If you don't believe me, read the orange text again.
