                <h4>Take things at your own pace!</h4>
                <p>We're all starting from a different place. I've found that just accepting that some things might take 
                    longer for me to grasp, while others will be easy, has been really helpful. 
                </p>

                <p>Some days you can breeze through several lessons at once. Other days it might take you 
                    several days to complete one lesson. Keep Going!
                </p>

                <h4>Find the fun!</h4>
                <p>You are <i>so</i> much more likely to stick to something if you find it fun. So far, 
                    I've 'found the fun' by adding custom, silly elements to my assignments. 
                </p>

                <p>Don't believe me? Think of the things you've tried in the past that were <i>FUN</i>
                and ended up being a huge part of your life. Maybe it was that team sport? Or the art class? 
                Or spending time with your grandparents!</p>

                <p>Keep looking on the fun and the lessons will be completed in no time!</p>

                <h4>Reward Objectives: big and small!</h4>

                <p>Logged into your account every day for a week? Get some ice-cream!</p>

                <p>Finished an entire lesson? Go for a walk in a beautiful park!</p>

                <p>Think of rewards you would love and use them to push yourself forward!</p>
